## Overview

### Purpose

Spoke's has a mission to guide nonprofits to achieve their goals through support and expert resources. The current process for displaying job listings is time-consuming and involves manual data entry, as job details from form submissions must be transferred manually from Google Sheets to the web display. This method is tedious and limits scalability. The goal is to create an automated job board where nonprofits can post job listings efficiently.
